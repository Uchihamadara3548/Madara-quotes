            <p class="wiki">Madara Uchiha was one of Naruto's strongest antagonist but he also gave the fandom some of its most introspective quotes.

One of the Big Three anime, Naruto, and by extension, Naruto Shippuden, remains one of the most popular and beloved franchises. Its interesting characters won the hearts of viewers, while also provoking their ire with incredible antagonists like the infamous Madara Uchiha. Despite his standing as one of the primary antagonists of Naruto Shippuden, he had a lifetime of wisdom to draw on. This included the famous Madara speech in which he affirmed that the only things to truly exist in the world were suffering, futility and pain.


As one of the main antagonists toward the end of the series, Madara rose from the dead to fulfill his lifelong dream of taking over the entire world. Torch-bearer for the Uchiha Clan and the epitome of their well-known superiority complex, Madara only ever lost to Konohagakure's first Hokage, Hashirama Senju. Both wise and strong, many of the most profound Madara Uchiha quotes are a bleak reminder that in life hope is scarce and suffering is imminent.</p>
